# About me

I'm enthusiastic About AGI. My evolution is the following:

- Started with learning physics,
- Continued with educational physics, with the purpose to build a computer software to serve as a tool to provide a more comprehensible and more understandable physics.
<br>Partcicpated in Prof. Miriam Reiner's <a style="color:#8dd3c7" href="https://vrneurocog.wixsite.com/vrneurocog/researchers">NeuroCognition in Education Lab</a>.<br>Though the tool was not expressed practically, its theoretical framework might be used later in AGI.
- Then continued with totally different field: Optimal control applied in transportation.<br>Partcipated in Prof. Jack Haddad's <a style="color:#8dd3c7" href="https://haddad.net.technion.ac.il/lab-members/">TSMART Lab</a>.
- Then moved on into AI field, applying Deep Learning (Supervised Learning via Graph Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning via Deep Q-Learning) in signal control problem at transportation network.
- During my studying the AI field, then Machine Learning and then Deep Learning, I encountered the fabulous and fascinating world of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).
